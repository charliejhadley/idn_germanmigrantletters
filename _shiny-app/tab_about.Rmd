<b>Project Title:</b> Understanding Immigrant Integration through Migrant Letters. Correspondence between German-speaking migrants in America and their families and friends 'back home'.
<br/>
The Forschungsbibliothek Gotha holds most of the letters in hard copy along with some additional information which we have not digitised. We are thankful for having been granted extensive access and helpful advice by Monika Hasenmüller. Wolfgang Helbich started the collection in the 1980s and Ursula Lehmkuhl now administers it.
